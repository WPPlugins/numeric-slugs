Use post titles and slugs made of only numbers.

== Description ==

When using /%postname%/ permalinks and a slug consisting of only numeric characters, WordPress incorrectly interprets this as pagination and doesn't handle things correctly. This plug-in will send users to the correct post.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `numeric-slugs` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
